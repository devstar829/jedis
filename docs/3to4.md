## Breaking Changes from Jedis 3 to Jedis 4 and Hints to Migrate

- BinaryJedis and BinaryJedisCluster classes have been removed.

  Methods of these classes are available in Jedis and JedisCluster classes respectively.

- Each of the following cases now throws an IllegalStateException instead of a JedisDataException.
  - `Cannot use Jedis when in Multi. Please use Transaction or reset Jedis state.`
  - `Cannot use Jedis when in Pipeline. Please use Pipeline or reset Jedis state.`

- Transaction inside Pipeline have been removed. E.g. multi(), exec() and discard() methods have
  been removed from Pipeline.

- execGetResponse() method has been removed from Transaction.

- `watch` and `unwatch` methods of Transaction class is unsupported within MULTI (after
  multi() method). These can be used before MULTI.

- JedisCluster constructors with `GenericObjectPoolConfig<Jedis>` now accepts
  `GenericObjectPoolConfig<Connection>`.

- JedisCluster constructors throws JedisClusterOperationException if these could not connect to any
  of the provided HostAndPort(s). Previously, these would go into unusable state.

- JedisCluster.getClusterNodes() returns `Map<String, ConnectionPool>` instead of
  `Map<String, JedisPool>`.

- JedisCluster.getConnectionFromSlot(int) returns `Connection` instead of `Jedis`.

- JedisNoReachableClusterNodeException has been removed. JedisClusterOperationException with a
  similar message is thrown instead.

- JedisClusterMaxAttemptsException has been removed. JedisClusterOperationException with with a
  similar message is thrown instead.

- JedisExhaustedPoolException has been removed. A JedisException with a similar message is thrown
  instead.

- Many SortedSet methods return Java `List` instead of `Set`. [Listed here](3to4-zset-list.md)

- Many methods return primitive values (`long`/`boolean`/`double` instead of `Long`/`Boolean`/
  `Double`). [Listed here](3to4-primitives.md)

- `scriptExists(byte[])` method now returns `Boolean` instead of `Long`.

- `scriptExists(byte[]...)` method now returns `List<Boolean>` instead of `List<Long>`.

- In [`xadd`](https://redis.io/commands/XADD) method with StreamEntryID parameter, sending untyped
  `null` raises conflict.

  Casting the `null` to StreamEntryID (`(StreamEntryID) null`) resolves this issue.

- In [`xrange`](https://redis.io/commands/XRANGE) and
  [`xrevrange`](https://redis.io/commands/xrevrange) methods with StreamEntryID parameters, sending
  untyped `null`s for both start and end parameters raises conflicts.

  Casting the `null`s to StreamEntryID (`(StreamEntryID) null`) resolves this issue.

- The return type of Jedis.shutdown() is now `void`. Previously, ideally, it would return null.

- `eval` and `evalsha` methods are now non-blocking. These have been blocking in Jedis 3.x.

- HostAndPort.`localhost` variable has been removed.

- These methods have been removed from HostAndPort class:
  - extractParts
  - parseString
  - convertHost
  - setLocalhost
  - getLocalhost
  - getLocalHostQuietly

- These classes have been moved to the `redis.clients.jedis.args` package.
  - BitOP
  - GeoUnit
  - ListPosition

- These classes have been moved to the `redis.clients.jedis.params` package.
  - BitPosParams
  - ScanParams
  - SortingParams
  - ZParams

- These classes have been moved to the `redis.clients.jedis.resps` package.
  - AccessControlLogEntry
  - AccessControlUser
  - GeoRadiusResponse
  - ScanResult
  - Slowlog
  - StreamConsumersInfo
  - StreamEntry
  - StreamGroupInfo
  - StreamInfo
  - StreamPendingEntry
  - StreamPendingSummary
  - Tuple

- Jedis and JedisPool constructors with a String parameter, and no int parameter only support a URL
  or URI string.
  - Jedis(String)
  - JedisPool(String)
  - JedisPool(String, SSLSocketFactory, SSLParameters, HostnameVerifier)
  - JedisPool(GenericObjectPoolConfig<Jedis>, String)

- Client and BinaryClient classes have been removed.

- `redis.clients.jedis.commands` package has been reimplemented, meaning Commands interfaces have
  been restructured.

- ShardedJedisPool, Sharded, ShardedJedis, BinaryShardedJedis, ShardInfo, JedisShardInfo classes
  have been removed.
  - Introduced JedisSharding class to replace ShardedJedisPool.

    Earlier code without the use of "name" and "weight" (in ShardInfo/JedisShardInfo) are
    transferable to the new class.

- ShardedJedisPipeline class has been removed.
  - Introduced ShardedPipeline class to replace ShardedJedisPipeline.

- The type of Protocol.CHARSET has been changed to `java.nio.charset.Charset`.

- Jedis.debug(DebugParams) method has been removed.

- DebugParams class has been removed.

- Jedis.sync() method has been removed.

- Jedis.pubsubNumSub(String...) method now returns `Map<String, Long>` instead of
  `Map<String, String>`.

- Sentinel methods have been removed from Jedis class and can be found in the new Sentinel class.

- `setDataSource` method in Jedis class now has `protected` access.

- JedisPoolAbstract class has been removed. Use Pool<Jedis>.

- Pool.initPool() method has been removed.

- Pool.getNumActive() now returns `0` (via GenericObjectPool) when the Pool is closed.

- Connection.getRawObjectMultiBulkReply() method has been removed. Use
  Connection.getUnflushedObjectMultiBulkReply() method.

- Queable.getResponse(Builder<T> builder) method has been renamed to
  Queable.enqueResponse(Builder<T> builder).

- All methods in Queable are now `final`:
  - clean()
  - generateResponse(Object data)
  - enqueResponse(Builder<T> builder)
  - getPipelinedResponseLength()

- These BuilderFactory implementations have been removed.
  - OBJECT (use RAW_OBJECT)
  - BYTE_ARRAY_ZSET (use BINARY_LIST or BINARY_SET)
  - BYTE_ARRAY_MAP (use BINARY_MAP)
  - STRING_ZSET (use STRING_LIST or STRING_SET)
  - EVAL_RESULT (use ENCODED_OBJECT)
  - EVAL_BINARY_RESULT (use RAW_OBJECT)

- All String variables representing Sentinel, Cluster and PubSub subcommands in Protocol class
  have been removed.

- ClientKillParams.Type has been removed. Use ClientType.

- ClusterReset has been removed. Use ClusterResetType.

- JedisClusterHostAndPortMap interface has been removed. Use the HostAndPortMapper interface.

- JedisClusterHashTagUtil class has been renamed to JedisClusterHashTag.

- KeyMergeUtil class has been removed.
